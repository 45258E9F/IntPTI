Libraries Used by CPAchecker
============================


Binary Libraries
----------------

Binary libraries should be provided via Ivy.

NOTE: If you add a binary library to CPAchecker, be sure to update MANIFEST.MF
with the Eclipse PDE wizard!

All libraries in the directory lib/java/ are managed by Apache Ivy.
To add libraries there, add them to the file ivy.xml.
Do not store any file in that directory, Ivy will delete it!
To generate a report listing all libraries managed by Ivy,
call "ant report-dependencies".
